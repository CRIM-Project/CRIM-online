The allusiveness of musical discourse is so fundamental to the Western tradition that it is hard to imagine a work that does not in some way make reference to some other composition, type or topic. Indeed, over the last 1000 years music has continued to reference earlier pieces, from the layered polyphony of medieval motets to the rampant borrowing of George Frideric Handel, from the topical allusions of film music to looped sampling heard in hip-hop. Citations: The Renaissance Imitation Mass (CRIM) focuses on an important but neglected part of this allusive tradition: the so-called “Imitation” or “Parody” Mass of the sixteenth century, in which short sacred or secular pieces were transformed into long five-movement cyclic settings of the Ordinary of the Catholic Mass:  Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei. The resulting works are far more than collections of quotations. The sheer scope of the transformation required the composer to re-think the model, adapting pre-existent melodies to fit new words, while shifting, extending, or compressing ideas in new musical contexts and to meet new expressive purposes. If counterpoint is a craft of combinations, then the Imitation Mass involves the art of recombination on a massive scale. These works offer an unparalleled way to learn how composers heard (and understood) each other’s music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why did Mass composers of the sixteenth century borrow in this way? And what effects did such transformations have upon listeners? Clerics like Bishop Cirillo Franco (a cleric associated with the Council of Trent during the 1560s) and St. Peter Canisius (a Jesuit preacher whose teachings were widely read in Renaissance Munich) famously complained of the non-liturgical and even profane influences that might obscure or corrupt the words of the Mass. And yet composers (even figures like Orlando di Lasso in Munich and Giovanni Pierliugi da Palestrina in Rome) persisted in using all sorts of sacred and secular polyphonic models in their Masses. Perhaps composers as well as listeners actually found the interplay between meanings of the Mass and the lyrics of the borrowed material spiritually engaging or even enlightening, as modern scholars (and CRIM participants) David Crook and Jessie Ann Owens have argued. On a purely musical level the composers of Imitation Masses (there are many hundreds of them in the repertory of sixteenth century music) reveal extraordinary inventiveness as they put contrapuntal patterns heard in their models through a series of displacements, recombinations, transformations, and rehearings in the five movements of the Ordinary as they were sung over the course of the larger drama enacted by the Mass itself. No wonder that composers sometimes seem to have competed with each other to see who might make the grandest transformation of a famous model.</p> \r\n<p>Our capacity to measure the Imitation Mass, however, has been dampened by two basic factors: the sheer number of possibilities for contrapuntal elaboration, and the idiosyncratic ways in which individual scholars have sought to explain and exemplify them. The CRIM project, with its digital capacities for managing citations, claims, and counter-claims in a collaborative environment, answers both of these key challenges in ways that will set the stage for the investigation of related corpora as well. It will open the digital investigation of the inner workings of musical counterpoint to new generations of students and emerging scholars, drawing musicologists into conversation with each other, and into collaborative projects with specialists in Renaissance studies, data science and the digital humanities more broadly.</p>\r\n<p>Building upon recent developments in digital music scholarship, this project implements a new kind of quotable text for music, along with the analysis and commentary that illuminates its workings. The CRIM project is the product of a long partnership between <strong>Haverford College</strong> and the <strong>Centre d’Études Supérieures de la Renaissance</strong> (Tours, France), and among an international <a href=\"https://crimproject.org/about/participants/\"><strong>team</strong></a> of scholars, students, and information technologists. It grapples with allusive relationships among musical works of the sixteenth century, and with the challenges of modeling scholarly annotations of these connections in the digital domain. Our work charts much new territory, exploring a neglected genre of Renaissance music via technologies that only a few years ago were beyond our grasp.

Sibelius files are used to prepare digitally engraved PDF scores of the highest graphical quality for use by performers and analysts. The Sibelius transcriptions are also exported as open-source XML files conforming to the <strong>Music Encoding Initiative</strong> (<a href=\"https://music-encoding.org/\">MEI</a>) schema using a <a href=\"https://github.com/music-encoding/sibmei/\"><strong>Sibelius Plug-in Extension</strong></a>. Although Sibelius is proprietary software, the plug-in itself is open source, and freely available for others to use and adapt; it is under continuous improvement by the MEI community. The resulting XML files are validated against the MEI schema, which assures their suitability for further transformation as part of rendering, citation, and analysis projects. Various Python “massaging” routines in turn prepare the MEI files for use with CRIM.</p>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml\"><strong>Verovio</strong></a> is a flexible Javascript kit that will render MEI (or MusicXML) easily in any html browser, without special software. It creates beautifully engraved images, PDFs, and can even render audio versions of the scores it reads. And since Verovio represents scores as a collection of an SVG objects, individual notes are in fact directly connected with the underlying MEI they represent, making it possible to render scores with selected <i>highlights</i>.</p>\r\n    <p>To learn more about the pathway from Sibelius to MEI to Verovio (and the web) see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xDdfeesO68-qU0EMBTcuXS7rbCcjykTsk3LMoSVW9RA/edit#slide=id.p\">This Demonstration</a>.</p>\r\n    <p><h4>Enhancing Music Addressability:  Portable Musical Citations</h4></p>\r\n    <p>Note-level citations are made possible by the <a href=\"http://mith.us/ema/omas\"><Strong>Open MEI Addressability Service (OMAS)</Strong></a> developed in conjunction with the <a href=\"https://github.com/umd-mith/ema/blob/master/docs/api.md\"><strong>Enhancing Music Notation Addressability API (EMA)</strong></a>, funded by an NEH Start-Up Grant.

With the help of Dr. Emilio Sanfilippo, a researcher in applied ontologies, the CRIM Project has recently (as of early 2023) implemented various Linked Open Data and Semantic Web technologies. Our work has centered on two key dimensions of how the CRIM Observations and Relationships:  works and claims about them. The result is a structured, open representation that connects the content of an analytic observation with information about the person responsible for making it in the first place, extending the “FAIR” concept of digital work (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) to include the no less crucial notion of Responsibility. Our <strong>Ontology for Analytic Claims in Music (OMAC)</strong> is fully implemented for CRIM data, with a SPARQL endpoint that can be queried by anyone. We have tested it with peers in the music encoding and semantic web communities. </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://crimproject.org/about/linked_data/\">CRIM and Linked Open Data</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><h4>Django Content Management System</h4></p>\r\n    <p>CRIM data are managed through a <strong>Django</strong> application, which assembles and stores the metadata and relevant MEI coordinates of the musical passages (using the OMAS service noted below) in a searchable relational database. A <strong>Solr</strong> indexing system continuously updates the array of pieces and analytic observations. Such systems are robust and scalable:  a similar system created for <a href=\"http://digitalduchemin.org\"><strong>The Lost Voices Project</strong></a> efficiently and rapidly manages over 11,000 analytic observations (including over a dozen different facets of metadata, from who made each one and what it is meant to represent), along with user accounts, private notes, and threaded discussions that update continuously.

We have consulted other sources, but CRIM editions are not critical in the sense explored in <a href=\"http://digitalduchemin.org/about/\"><strong>The Lost Voices Project</strong></a>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Incipits.</strong> These appear in the <strong>PDF</strong> edition for each piece (linked via the Work View for each composition) give the original clefs, background system, mensuration sign, and musical notation up to and including the first tone of each voice part. Incipits to not appear in the <strong>MEI</strong> files.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Mensuration.</strong> In the musical transcriptions we have retained the original note values, and of course both added bar lines and arranged the individual parts in score format. <i>Tempus imperfectum diminutum</i> (\"cut C\") is the prevailing mensuration throughout these compositions, and thus one tempus (breve) in the original notation normally corresponds to one measure in the modern transcription. In some transcriptions it has also been necessary to use isolated irregular bars of one semibreve duration. Since these are not distinguished in the original source, we have refrained from marking a temporary change in mensuration in the engraved PDF editions (but they do appear in the MEI encodings rendered with Verovio). Singers can simply follow these as an extra tactus (semibreve) within the phrase. Tempus perfectum in the original sources are indicated by \"3\". We have preserved both this sign and the \"cut C\" in the modern transcriptions.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Clefs.</strong> Modern clefs are used in the transcriptions; original clefs can be seen via the incipits found in the engraved PDFs (they do not appear in the rendered MEI). Contratenor and similar inner parts often use the modern treble or the (transposing) tenor G clef, according to the needs of spacing and alignment with text.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Accidentals.</strong> Flat and sharp signs appearing on the staff lines themselves correspond to signs given in the original sources. According to modern editorial pracitice, any sign appearing at the start of a bar is considered valid for that part for the duration of the measure.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Sharps and Naturals.</strong> The same symbol is used for both natural and sharp in Renaissance sources. Sixteenth-century typesetters and scribes normally did not conceive of these signs in the same way that modern readers do: they did not indicate absolute pitch, so much as relative position in a half-step relationship (\"<i>mi-fa</i>,\" in the system of solmization). The flat sign (<i>b-mollum</i>) designated the upper (\"<i>fa</i>\") position; the sharp sign (<i>b-durum</i>) designated the lower (\"<i>mi</i>\") position. Sixteenth-century singers understood F-sharp and B-natural each as a \"<i>mi</i>\" (since they stood directly adjacent to G and C respectively). Scribes and editors of the period thus made no distinction between the sign for a sharp and a natural (as modern readers would understand them). For the convenience of modern readers, we differentiate these functions according to modern practice. All such accidentals are understood to be valid for all the notes for a given voice appearing in a given bar, as in modern practice.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Musica ficta.</strong> Accidentals appearing above the staff in the modern transcription are implied by contrapuntal contexts—in order to avoid forbidden intervals with other signed alterations, or in order to create complete cadences. Such changes have been determined by the editors in accordance with sixteenth-century theoretical practice (further on these see the <a href=\"http://ricercar-old.cesr.univ-tours.fr/3-programmes/EMN/duchemin/pages/Practical%20and%20Theoretical.pdf\"><i>Practical and Theoretical Aspects of the Du Chemin Chansonniers</i></a> in the commentaries to <a href=\"http://digitalduchemin.org/about/\"><strong>The Lost Voices Project</strong></a>. These signs are valid only for the note over which they appear. In the MEI editions of CRIM pieces, the editorial accidentals have been encoded according to MEI practice. See the <strong>Technology</strong> section of these menus for more information on the workflows used to produce these encodings.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Ligatures and minor coloration.</strong> Ligatures have been marked with a continuous horizontal bracket above the notes they connect, and serve to confirm text underlay by preventing a change of syllable. Minor coloration (a darkened semibreve and darkened minim) has the same notational significance as a dotted minim followed by a crochet. Sixteenth-century typesetters used these two forms interchangeably. We nevertheless indicate the use of minor color with a pair of open horizontal brackets above the notes in question, since such information could have importance in determining relationships among sources.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Repeat Signs.</strong> Repeat signs in the original parts have been retained in the modern transcriptions. First and second endings have been regularized among the voice parts, normally to provide a common point of alignment. As noted above, in some cases it has been necessary to introduce an irregular bar (the equivalent of half the duration of the usual tempus imperfectum diminutum) in conjunction with such repeats. In some instances, the original sources used a repeat sign for the last phrase in two voices (such as superius and tenor) but written out this repeated phrase in full for the other parts, depending on how much room was available to the typesetters. In such cases we have realized the full repeat without special comment in the edition, since the two ways of presenting the text result in the same sounding result.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"span6\">\r\n<p><h2>Literary and Sacred Texts</h2></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Capitalization.</strong> Here we follow the general system used by sixteenth-century typesetters, who used a capital (majuscule) for the first letter of each new poetic line. We preserve this capitalization for repetitions in cases where the first word of a line is repeated. As in the case of orthography and punctuation we adopt a majority rule approach to differences among the various voice parts. For the text of the <strong>Ordinary</strong> of the <strong>Catholic Mass</strong> we have adopted a regular system of capitilization based on the syntactic divisions of the text.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Orthography.</strong> Spelling differences among individual voice parts have been regularized according to majority rule, unless the variant spelling(s) suggest some potential alternative meaning or word play. <strong>Abbreviations</strong> are realized without explanation or comment.  <strong>U/V</strong> and <strong>I/J</strong>, often represented each by a single character in early editions, have been differentiated from each other. <strong>Accents</strong> in French and Italian texts follow the original typography; we have nevertheless added accents to avoid semantic ambiguity (such as \"a\" for \"à\").</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Punctuation</strong>. Punctuation follows that given in the original sources, either at line endings, or for medial pauses and repetitions of individual words. As in the case of spellings, here, too, we have opted to regularize punctuation according to majority rule. In the case of a tie between rival readings, we have chosen to include punctuation rather than omit it. Punctuation for text repetitions (either indicated in the source or based on editorial suggestions) follows this rule: the first statement of a line or part of a line is separated from the repetition by a comma.  Subsequent repetitions are also separated from each other by a comma. There is no additional comma between the repetition and the continuation of the line to which it belongs. The original punctuation (whether comma, colon, or period) appears at the end of the text of that line.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Text Repetition and Character Styles Used in the Modern Transcriptions</strong>. Roman type indicates texts written out in the original source, italic type indicates editorial realizations of text repetitions plainly intended by the original scribe or typesetters with \"ij\". Roman type in square brackets \"[  ]\" indicates emendations, interpolations, or suggestions of the modern editor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\t<p><h2>Text underlay principles</h2></p>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Phrases proceed syllabically, saving extra notes for the penultimate syllable of the line.  The last note of each phrase normally receives the last syllable of the poetic line.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Repeated pitches normally imply a change of syllable, since to do otherwise would result in awkward vocal articulations.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Semi-minims rarely receive their own syllable. The major exception to this guideline is the first note of a melismatic line of short notes (semi-minims), which often is marked with a new syllable. Otherwise the next syllable after that is reserved for the note _after_ the minim that follows this series. Thus the first minim after a series of short notes does not normally get a new syllable, nor should the intervening short notes. Except in pieces with a great deal of nonsense syllables or other declamatory gestures, singers were advised against putting a new syllable on each of a series of notes less than a semi-minim.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Syncopations and melodic leaps are often good places to change syllables, particularly in long phrases.</li>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>Syllabification.</strong> The careful alignment of text and tone depends of course on the careful placement of particular syllables with particular notes. And this in turn depends on a systematic approach to the division of words themselves into their constituent syllables. With French texts our general approach has been to follow the conventions suggested in modern reference works such as Maurice Grevisse, <i>Le bon usage</i>, 11th rev. edn, 2e tirage, Duculoy, 1980.  But these principles need to be adapted to the problems at hand in sixteenth-century orthography (where spellings differ considerably from modern equivalents) and for the case of poetry destined for musical performance in particular, since spoken language might well avoid certain articulations that are in fact necessitated by musical renderings of the same words. Solutions for special problems include: dividing between s and t in words containing this pair together:  \"es-tre\" \"tes-tes\" \"es-tain-dre\"; <i>not</i>dividing between c and t in words containing this pair, since they are often written in sixteenth-century sources as one character and in any case reflect Latin roots: \"re-trai-cte\"; breaking words with \"y\" as part of a three-vowel combination with the preceding vowel it modifies:  \"loy-au-té\" \"soy-ons\".</li>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>Elisions and liaisons</strong>. French poets of the sixteenth century often experimented with ways to extend and manipulate standard metrical and versification forms.  Most important of these for our musical transcriptions are the many instances in which the final vowel of one word was meant to be elided into the first vowel of a following one (such as \"el-le_ai-me\", which would thus be sung as three syllables instead of four). Such elisions or liaisons can appear in various positions in the poetic line. No matter where they appear, they present special challenges and solutions for the modern editor.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "enable_comments": false, "template_name": "", "registration_required": false, "sites": [2]}}, {"model": "flatpages.flatpage", "pk": 10, "fields": {"url": "/musical_types/", "title": "Musical and Relationship Types", "content": "Visit the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/haverford.edu/crim-project/vocabularies/musical-types\" target=\"_blank\">Musical Types Document</a> and <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/haverford.edu/crim-project/vocabularies/relationship-types\"target=\"_blank\">the Relationship Types Document</a> on the CRIM Editor's Hub.", "enable_comments": false, "template_name": "", "registration_required": false, "sites": [2]}}, {"model": "flatpages.flatpage", "pk": 12, "fields": {"url": "/linked_data/", "title": "Linked Open Data", "content": "<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n <body>\r\n    <div class=\"row-fluid\">\r\n        <div class=\"span6\">\r\n<p><h3>Linked Open Data and The CRIM Project</h3></p>\r\n<p>With the help of Dr. Emilio Sanfilippo, a researcher in applied ontologies, the CRIM Project has recently (as of early 2023) implemented various Linked Open Data and Semantic Web technologies.

Reports from the CRIM Project</h3></p>\r\n<p>As noted elsewhere in these commentaries, <strong>CRIM Intervals</strong> has become a transformative resource in the project, and quite possibly for the digital approach to Renaissance music more generally. It did not emerge all at once, of course, and has been subject to an iterative process of evaluation and improvement. The full scope of what it can do is impossible to describe in detail here, but through its capacity to make quick work of finding notes, rhythms, melodies, harmonies, counterpoint, and even high-level patterns like cadences and points of imitation, it has transformed the work of CRIM analysts. Now participants can spend more of their time explaining and interpreting the connections between pieces rather than simply finding the patterns in the first place. And thanks to Pandas and its related suite of data analysis, the possibilities for exploring complex networks of similarity are virtually limitless. The <a href=\"http://essays.crimproject.org\"><strong>CRIM Essays and Experiments</strong></a>, edited by Richard Freedman testify to the exciting possibilities now before us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their recent paper for the CRIM Essays and Experiments, Sylvain Margot and Peter Schubert aptly described the benefits of working with the CRIM Intervals tools. Through it, they found a way not so much to answer their analytic questions, but rather to expose their own biases.  Writing of the inevitable gap between their own stance as modern analysts and that of composers of the distant past, they observe that:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There are two ways to deal with this uncertainty, we could try to read more historical treatises more carefully, or we could try to be more “objective,” that is to find a way not to let our biases interfere, or at least to make them more explicit. In the following pages we take the latter view, interrogating the role the computer might have in the conventional analysis of individual pieces of Renaissance music (as opposed to corpus study). As we will show, it not only makes it easier to answer certain questions, it causes us to reimagine the role of the analyst.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<citation>Sylvain Margot and Peter Schubert. 2023. <a href=\"https://crimwp.richardfreedman.sites.haverford.edu/?page_id=391\">“With Baccusi in the Jacuzzi; or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Numbers.”</a> <i>CRIM Essays and Experiments</i>, ed. Richard Freedman. Haverford College and CRIM Project.</citation>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"span6\">\r\n\r\n<p>Margot and Schubert are unique in stating the effect so clearly. But all CRIM participants recognize how digital tools force us to make explicit things we know only implicitly, and through long experience with this music. In playing back the results of our formulations to us, our algorithms make us newly aware of biases we did not know we had. This is another of the contradictory effects of digital work: exposing the human in the machine. These tools cannot think, but they materialize thought in ways that force us to reflect on our own methods. Indeed, the process of “tool criticism” was identified during our CRIM@Tours conference by Professor Frans Wiering (Utrecht University) as perhaps the most interesting and important part of the process (see <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UIAn7T\"><strong>Wiering’s slides</strong></a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is thus tempting, as CRIM developer Daniel Russo-Batterham put it, to divide the CRIM into “tool creators” and “tool users.”  But the dichotomy is better understood as a continuum. It is true, for instance, that CRIM Intervals began as the work of a very few. It is also true that the students and scholars who first encountered the system found it something altogether alien, and decidedly unmusical in its literalism. But even before gaining any sort of technical proficiency in developing the tools themselves, users were ready to offer feedback on what worked well and what did not, shaping debates on where future work should be focussed. And as CRIM Intervals moved to the interactive Jupyter Notebook platform, the interactive process of criticism, experimentation, and improvement became still more rapid. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Such direct involvement in the creation, refinement, and interrogation of tools, has in turn prompted individuals to explore with new methods, and new insights about the music, both in its details and from a distance. These essays and experiments are the first fruits of these efforts.\r\n</div>", "enable_comments": false, "template_name": "", "registration_required": false, "sites": [2]}}, {"model": "flatpages.flatpage", "pk": 14, "fields": {"url": "/crim_intervals/", "title": "CRIM Intervals", "content": "<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n <body>\r\n    <div class=\"row-fluid\">\r\n        <div class=\"span6\">\r\n<p><h3>CRIM Intervals:  A Python Library for Analysis</h3></p>\r\n<p>Based on Python, Pandas, and Mike Cuthbert's <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/music21/\">music21</a>, <strong>CRIM Intervals</strong> is a pattern finding engine for musical scores, with an emphasis on the kinds of melodic and harmonic patterns found in Renaissance polyphony. It has been developed as a primary data analysis tool for CRIM, but can be applied and adapted to a wide range of styles. Results are reported in Pandas dataframes (and thus exportable in a variey of standard formats for further analysis), and also via several visualizations methods.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><h4>The Basics</h4></p>\r\n<p>CRIM Intervals begins by importing one (or more) MEI, MusicXML, and MIDI files, for example: <code>piece = importScore('https://crimproject.org/mei/CRIM_Model_0008.mei')</code> Once imported this <code>piece</code> object can be explored in various ways. <code>piece.notes()</code>, for instance, produces a dataframe in which each staff (voice part) is represented as a column of events--notes, rests, durations, lyrics, etc. Other methods (see the list below) in turn present these basic events in many different ways:  as melodic intervals, harmonic intervals, n-grams, contrapuntal \"modules\", and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways to configure these basic methods. For instance intervals can be diatonic, or chromatic, or with (and without) 'quality' (such as M3 vs m3). They can also be simple or compound (a tenth in the latter would be a third in the former).Unisons can be combined (something helpful for comparing similar melodies), or events can be taken at actual durations or 'sampled' at some regular durational span.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complete documentation of each method capacities is available via doc.strings via this command <code>print(model.YourMethod.__doc__)</code>, where you will replace 'YourMethod' with the name of the individual method, for example <code>print(piece.melodic.__doc__)</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><h4>Key Methods in CRIM Intervals</h4></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>piece.notes()</code>, which finds all the notes and rests in a score, with a tabular score-like representation of the pitches, pitch classes, and durations (expressed in music21 \"offsets\", in which each quarter note corresponds to the value of 1.0). It can also derminte the location of any note as a measure+beat reference with detailIndex</li>\r\n<li><code>piece.melodic()</code>, which finds melodic intervals in any voice part, with various options for diatonic, chromatic and zero-based distances. Intervals can be compound (distinguishing between tenths and thirds, for instance), or simple, and can include quality (distinguishing major and minor thirds, for instance), or not.</li>\r\n<li><code>piece.harmonic()</code>, which finds harmonic intervals between every combination of two voices in a piece, with various options for diatonic and chromatic. These intervals can also be directed (as when a tenor voice sounds above the altus), or not.</li>\r\n<li><code>piece.lyrics()</code> (for every note)</li>\r\n<li><code>piece.durations()</code>, with quarter-note = 1.0, as per music21.</li>\r\n<li><code>piece.ngrams()</code>, which finds n-grams of any length in each voice part. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram\"> n-grams </a>are frequently used in linguistic analysis (), and can help us find repeating patterns within and among works. The ngram tool can be used for any of the methods above:  melodic, harmonic, durations, lyrics. By default it finds contrapuntal modules, which represent in numerical values a combination of the vertical intervals made between any two voices with the melodic intervals heard in the motion of the lower voice. A module of <code>7_Held 6_-2, 8</code> for instance, represents vertical intervals of 7, 6, 8 between two voices and in the lower voice a tied note followed by a descending second. Together these five events represent a typical cadence formula. Repeating modules are a key part of Renaissance contrapuntal style.</li>\r\n<li>It is also possible to apply various <strong>edit distance</strong> tools to many of these patterns, thus allowing users to find exact and close matches.\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"span6\">\r\n<p><h5>Classification of Contrapuntal Types</h5></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRIM Intervals also include advanced methods that use combinations of the methods detailed above to predict \"contrapuntal types\" commonly found in Renaissance polyphony. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n   <li>Cadences are one such type:  <code>piece.cadences()</code> can find them with a high degree of accuracy. </li>\r\n   <li>We have also developed a method that predict various imitative textures, including Fugas, Imitative Duos, and Periodic Entries (as Peter Schubert has named them):  <code>piece.presentationTypes()</code>.</li>\r\n   <li>It is also possible to accurately identify homorhythmic passages (where sets of voices move in the same durations and declaim the same lyrics):  <code>piece.homorhythm()</code>. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n   <p>In each case we there are various options users can select to refine the searches, including various tools that allow for 'similar' no less than 'exact' matches.\r\n   Melodic and rhythmic 'flexing' is a key part of Renaissance counterpoint. These methods are too complex to summarize in a short space. But they are powerful tools for machine prospecting of musical works. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><h5>Heatmaps, Graphs, and Networks</h5></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRIM Intervals also features tools that help us visualize musical events in different ways, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n   <li>bar charts and histograms of events (such as notes, or intervals), which are useful for understand ranges, distributions, and other large-scale distribution of categorical data)</li>\r\n   <li>heatmaps, showing <i>where</i> in a piece patterns (such as repeating n-grams) occur</li>\r\n   <li>radar plots, used to show cadences in a radial plot that reveals the tonal profile of a composition (or a corpus of works)</li>\r\n   <li>progress charts, showing a cadences in a series (from start to finish)</li>\r\n   <li>network diagrams, showing related patterns or pieces</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n   \r\n\r\n<p><h5>One Piece, or a Corpus</h5></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRIM Intervals methods can also be applied to a corpus of pieces.  We first define a corpus:  <code>corpus = CorpusBase(['https://crimproject.org/mei/CRIM_Mass_0006_1.mei', 'https://crimproject.org/mei/CRIM_Mass_0006_2.mei', 'https://crimproject.org/mei/CRIM_Mass_0006_3.mei'])</code>, then specify a method to run against each piece in the corpus:  <code>corpus.batch(func=ImportedPiece.cadences)</code>.  The results are reported as a combined dataframe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><h5>Render Scores (or Excertps) with Verovio</h5></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRIM Intervals also has the capacity to render results as modern score with Laurent Pugin's <a href=\"https://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml\">Verovio</a> <code>piece.verovioCadences()</code>, as well as reporting them as data frames and visualizations (for more on that see below). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><h5>Code, Tutorials, and Jupyter Notebooks</h5></p>\r\n<p>Find <a href=\"https://github.com/HCDigitalScholarship/intervals\">CRIM Intervals Code on github</a></p>\r\n<p>Learn more and try out CRIM Intervals at: <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/haverford.edu/crim-project/search-and-analysis#h.93tadecmdqec\">Tutorials and Jupyter Notebooks for CRIM Intervals</a>  </p>\r\n\r\n</div>", "enable_comments": false, "template_name": "", "registration_required": false, "sites": [2]}}]
